A request platform as a mobile application catering to students in college residences.

## Motivation

We are a group of students from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and we stay in on-campus residences. There have been times when we have needed something urgently but our friend groups just aren't replying to our messages.  We have also encountered several instances when we have need a meal but have had no time to buy food for ourselves. As a result, we were motivated to design a mobile application where we could request something we may need from everyone in our residence, be it stationery, cleaning supplies, or even food delivery, and obtain it as quickly as possible. Hence, our app aims to expedite the process of requesting and responding to such requests, such that more students can get what they need more efficiently.

## Description

When in urgent need of something within your on-campus residence, simply fill in a new request on the request page. Once your request is submitted, all other users within the same residence will be notified of your request.

Users who are able to help with a particular request can accept the request via our respond page, which will subsequently notify the person who made the request and complete the transaction.

Attached below is a PDF file which contains a concept map of the routing within the application.
