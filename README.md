# please

A request platform as a mobile application catering to students in college residences.

## Motivation

We are a group of students from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and we stay in on-campus residences. There have been times when we have needed something urgently but our friend groups just aren't to replying our messages.  We have also encountered several instances where we had needed a meal but have had no time to buy food for ourselves. As a result, we were motivated to design a mobile application where we could request something we may need from everyone in our residence, be it stationery, cleaning supplies, or even food delivery, and obtain it as quickly as possible. Hence, our app aims to expedite the process of requesting and responding to such requests, such that more students can get what they need more efficiently.
